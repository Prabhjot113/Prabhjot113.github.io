*UHV LECTURE*

Universal Human Values (UHV): This class taught us about important values and ethics.

The purpose of education is to facilitate the development of clarity on the aspiration and adequate competence to actualize it. For this, it is essential to understand what a happy, fulfilling and successful life is ‚Äì what is really valuable for human being; what is our purpose as a human being? Understanding human aspiration, or what is really valuable for human being, is the value domain. The subject which enables us to understand this domain is called ‚ÄòValue Education‚Äô (VE). It enables us to understand our aspirations and visualise our goals for a fulfilling life and indicates the direction for their fulfillment. In relation to these issues, it also helps to remove our confusions and contradictions. In that sense, VE addresses the issues related to ‚Äòwhat to do?‚Äô.It is also necessary to learn the skills to actualise our aspirations. This is the skill domain. The subject which enables us to learn the skills is called ‚ÄòSkill Development‚Äô (SD). It enables us to learn the science, technology, management and other skills for fulfilling our aspiration

Guidelines for Value Education

For any input to qualify for Value Education, the following guidelines for the content of the course are important: Universal:It has to be universally applicable to all human beings for all time and all places. This implies that values should not change according to sect, creed, nationality, gender, etc.

Rational: It has to appeal to reasoning; and not be based on dogmas or blind beliefs. It has to be open to address the related questions. It cannot be a set of sermons or do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts.

Natural and Verifiable: It has to be ‚Äònaturally acceptable‚Äô to the human being and there needs to be every provision in nature for its fulfillment. It needs to be experientially verifiable, and not based on dogmas, beliefs or assumptions. It is not merely an intellectual exercise or information transfer.

All Encompassing: It needs to cover all dimensions (thought, behaviour, work and understanding) and levels (individual, family, society and nature/existence) of human life.

Universal Human Values Handout 1 of 5 Introduction to Value Education Leading to Harmony: It ultimately needs to promote harmony within the individual, among human beings and with the entire nature.
In this lacture we learned a lot.

Today marked another engaging day in our induction program, blending rigorous academic work with exciting new explorations in technology. The day kicked off with an intensive Math lecture from 9 AM to 12:30 PM. The session was a deep dive into Maths, providing a solid foundation and a few challenging problems to tackle. It was a good mix of theory and practical applications, and I felt more confident in my understanding of the material. After a brief lunch break, we returned for a Math test from 1:30 PM to 3 PM. The test covered everything we‚Äôve learned so far, and it was a great opportunity to assess our progress. While some questions were challenging, I felt well-prepared thanks to the comprehensive lectures and practice problems we‚Äôve been working on. Post-test, I attended a meeting for CodeGNE, our college‚Äôs coding and tech club. Today‚Äôs session was particularly intriguing as students presented on OpenSCAD, an open-source software for 3D modeling. The presentation covered the basics of 3D design, from creating simple geometric shapes to more complex structures. I was fascinated by how code could translate into tangible designs, and it opened my eyes to the potential of 3D printing and modeling in various fields.The highlight was a live demonstration where we saw how altering the code could change the design in real-time. It was an inspiring session, sparking ideas for future projects and collaborations. I‚Äôm eager to explore OpenSCAD further and perhaps even create some designs of my own.
