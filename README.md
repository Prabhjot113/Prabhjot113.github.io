UHV LECTURE

Universal Human Values (UHV): This class taught us about important values and ethics.

The purpose of education is to facilitate the development of clarity on the aspiration and adequate competence to actualize it. For this, it is essential to understand what a happy, fulfilling and successful life is ‚Äì what is really valuable for human being; what is our purpose as a human being? Understanding human aspiration, or what is really valuable for human being, is the value domain. The subject which enables us to understand this domain is called ‚ÄòValue Education‚Äô (VE). It enables us to understand our aspirations and visualise our goals for a fulfilling life and indicates the direction for their fulfillment. In relation to these issues, it also helps to remove our confusions and contradictions. In that sense, VE addresses the issues related to ‚Äòwhat to do?‚Äô.It is also necessary to learn the skills to actualise our aspirations. This is the skill domain. The subject which enables us to learn the skills is called ‚ÄòSkill Development‚Äô (SD). It enables us to learn the science, technology, management and other skills for fulfilling our aspiration

Guidelines for Value Education

For any input to qualify for Value Education, the following guidelines for the content of the course are important: Universal:It has to be universally applicable to all human beings for all time and all places. This implies that values should not change according to sect, creed, nationality, gender, etc.

Rational: It has to appeal to reasoning; and not be based on dogmas or blind beliefs. It has to be open to address the related questions. It cannot be a set of sermons or do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts.

Natural and Verifiable: It has to be ‚Äònaturally acceptable‚Äô to the human being and there needs to be every provision in nature for its fulfillment. It needs to be experientially verifiable, and not based on dogmas, beliefs or assumptions. It is not merely an intellectual exercise or information transfer.

All Encompassing: It needs to cover all dimensions (thought, behaviour, work and understanding) and levels (individual, family, society and nature/existence) of human life.

Universal Human Values Handout 1 of 5 Introduction to Value Education Leading to Harmony: It ultimately needs to promote harmony within the individual, among human beings and with the entire nature.

In this lacture we learned a lot.

üñáÔ∏è**Day 5: Discovering the IT Department‚Äôs Vision and Mission**
____________________________________

Today was our fifth day of college, and it was filled with insightful and educational experiences.

Introduction to the IT Department
We began by gathering outside the IT department, where the energy was high with anticipation for the day's activities. Our professors led us to the hardware lab, where we were introduced to the department's core values and objectives.

Understanding the Vision and Mission
In the hardware lab, our professors explained the vision and mission of the IT department. The vision is especially inspiring: to educate students from rural areas and transform them into professionals. This dedication to empowering rural students highlights the department's commitment to inclusive education and social progress.

The mission focuses on preparing us to face the challenges of the rapidly changing tech industry through a thorough curriculum and hands-on learning experiences.

Program-Based Outcomes
We also explored the program-based outcomes, which detail the skills and competencies we are expected to develop during our course. These include technical expertise, problem-solving skills, effective communication, teamwork, and a mindset geared towards lifelong learning. Understanding these outcomes provided us with a clear guide on what we need to achieve and how the department will support us in this journey.

Exploring the IT Department Labs
Following the enlightening session in the hardware lab, we visited various other labs within the IT department. Each lab provided insights into different aspects of IT, from software development to network systems and more. These visits were very informative, allowing us to see the practical applications of our coursework and the resources available to us.

CodeGNE Meeting: Learning to Improvise
Later, we attended a CodeGNE meeting focused on improvisation. We learned several strategies and techniques to improve our problem-solving skills and adaptability. The discussion offered valuable insights on how to think quickly and make effective decisions in dynamic situations.

Reflections
Today's experiences underscored the importance of values, creativity, and adaptability in our academic and personal growth. The lecture on Universal Human Values reminded me that happiness and contentment are crucial in shaping our lives. The Canva session opened up new creative possibilities, and the doubt session reinforced the importance of teamwork and guidance.

Reflecting on today's events, I am motivated to contribute to and benefit from the department's vision. I look forward to the challenges and opportunities ahead, knowing they are part of a well-defined path to success.
